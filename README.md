PureLine - A Pure Bash Powerline PS1 Command Prompt
===================================================

*__Pureline is currently in development and subject to frequent changes. Updates are likely to change the format of the configuration file and therefore break configuration files from previous versions. Please be aware when updating, it is highly likely you will need to change your config file!__*

A simple but powerful [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) style prompt for the Bash shell written in Bash script.

Pureline was inspired by [Bash-Powerline-Shell](https://github.com/abhijitvalluri/bash-powerline-shell) and is designed to make configuration easy, using either full 256 color or just the basic terminal colors - allowing colors to be set by the terminal (eg Xresources or profiles).

All the segments are optional and can be enabled or disabled in a config file.

### Unicode symbols used

* Hard separator between segments`ÓÇ∞`
* Soft separator betwen segments of the same color: `ÓÇ±`
* Read-only status of current directory: `ÓÇ¢`
* Return code from previous bash command: `‚öë`
* Number of background jobs: `‚èé` followed by number
* Python Virtual Environment:`Œª`
* AWS Profile: `‚òÅ`
* Battery indicator when charging:`‚ö°`
* Battery indicator when discharging:`‚ñÆ`
* Git Branch: `ÓÇ†`
* Git Stash: `üêø`
* Number of modified files in git repo: `‚úö`
* Number of staged files in git repo: `‚úî`
* Number of conflicted files in git repo: `‚úò`

# Setup

## Prerequisites

* Some of the unicode symbols require a special font to be used in your terminal. Please use one of the powerline fonts available at: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts

  * [DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono) is a popular choice
  * The screenshots above use [Hack for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/Hack)

* Almost all current terminals have the unicode support needed by PureLine. If you have used PowerLine fonts before, then you already know if Pureline will be supported in your terminal. But if you do have issues with any of the symbols, try testing a different terminal, eg, `uxterm` in place of `xterm`.

## Install

### Git Clone

    $ git clone https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline.git
    $ cp pureline/configs/powerline_full_256col.conf ~/.pureline.conf

* In your `.bashrc` or `.profile`, whichever is used, source the `pureline` script as follows:

    source ~/pureline/pureline ~/.pureline.conf

The powerline fonts need more effort to work on tty screens, so a useful tip is to only source PureLine if you are on a gui;

    if [ "$TERM" != "linux" ]; then
        source ~/pureline/pureline ~/.pureline.conf
    fi

__Note__ on some terminals, when scrolling at the bottom of the screen, long line wrapped prompts, can cause background color to bleed between lines. If you experience this please set ```PL_ERASE_TO_EOL=true`.

## Customization

Some example configuration files are provided. The config file contains lines which are sourced by PureLine. The segments to be used are listed in the PL_segmentS environment variablee;

        PL_SEGMENTS=(
            # Segment                Background  Foreground
            'user_segment            2              7'
            'path_segment            13             7'
            'read_only_segment       8              7'
        )

To remove a segment, comment or delete the relevant line. You can rearrange the segments in any order you prefer. The first two parameters are background and foreground colors which can be customized. Some segments may have additional options.

### Colors

Color themes can be set in your config using the PL_COLOR option;

```PL_COLOR='solarized'```

You can find the available themes in the pureline/colors directory.

#### Color Themes

Color themes 

Color themes are defined by the PL_COLORS array. You can create a color set in either 256 or RGB;

        # RGB Example
        PL_COLORS=(             PL_COLORS=(
            [0]='47;30;46'          [0]='0'
            [1]='65;50;63'          [1]='1'
            [2]='79;66;76'          [2]='2'
            [3]='119;110;113'       [3]='3'
            [4]='141;134;135'       [4]='4'
            [5]='163;158;155'       [5]='5'
            [6]='185;182;176'       [6]='6'
            [7]='231;233;219'       [7]='7'
            [7]='255;255;255'       [8]='8'
            [8]='239;97;85'         [9]='9'
            [9]='249;155;21'        [10]='10'
            [10]='254;196;24'       [11]='11'
            [11]='72;182;133'       [12]='12'
            [12]='91;196;191'       [13]='13'
            [13]='6;182;239'        [14]='14'
            [14]='129;91;164'       [15]='15'
            [15]='233;107;168'      [16]='16'
        )

You can have as many or as few colors defined in your set as needed, but do remember to update the colors your segments use. When designing new color themes you can either create a new file and share it in the colors directory, or place the definition in your config file. The advantage of a color theme file means you can source the file and hot switch color themes.

## Developing New Segments

New segments can be easily created by following a template from existing functions. For example:

        function time_segment {
            local bg_color="$1"     # First argument passes the background color
            local fg_color="$2"     # Second argument passes the foreground color
            local content="\t"      # Set the content you want to display
            local symbol
            segment_end symbol "${fg_color}" "${bg_color}"
            segment_content content "${fg_color}" "${bg_color}"
            PS1+="${end_symbol} ${content} "
            __last_color="${bg_color}"
        }

The $content variable can be modified to show any output wanted on the prompt.

You can place segment code anywhere it will be sourced:

* For segments of personal use I would recommend adding it to your config file.
* For developing new external segments for PureLine, you should but them in the <code>pureline/segments</code> directory. The file name and function name must be the same. Eg <code>./pureline/segments/battery_segment</code> will have the segment function named as <code>function battery_segment {}</code>
